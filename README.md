## About
At Javascript chapter during the **Web Development** course at **ITSchool** I had to do a dictionary app (only in English due to API) using free API from [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) ðŸ“–.

The application is simple, the basic features that need to be included is to show meaning (additionally: phonetic, example and partOfSpeech). The visitor just type the word in input and submit by click 'Find' or Enter.

**The function below is an example of solution how to find phonetic of the word**
```javascript
const isHereWordPhonetic = (word) => {
                            let phoneticFound = data[0].phonetics;
                            for (let i = 0; i < phoneticFound.length; i++) {
                                if(phoneticFound[i].text){
                                    wordPhonetic.innerText =` - ${phoneticFound[i].text}`;
                                    return phoneticFound[i];
                                }
                            }
                            wordPhonetic.innerText = ``;
                        }
                        isHereWordPhonetic(data);
```

The API I used was the free of the [free dictionary api](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).
